Predicting the possibility of getting heart-attack based on provided factors

Heart Disease Prediction

This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning workflow for predicting heart disease. 

Data Exploration: Thorough analysis and visualization of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations among key features related to heart disease.

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features, along with selecting the most relevant features to improve model accuracy.

Model Implementation: Comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and others, to identify the best-performing model.

Evaluation Metrics: Use of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

Insights & Interpretability: Analysis of feature importance and other explanatory methods to provide actionable insights into the factors influencing heart disease risk.


This project not only demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques but also emphasizes the importance of interpretability and decision-making in healthcare analytics.
